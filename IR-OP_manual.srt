1
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:15,951
If you want to walk, here is fine.

2
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:24,292
Even though loneliness is sometimes too much

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,633
Neither you hurting others

4
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:39,641
Nor others hurting you happens here

5
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:47,182
On the other side over the frozen sea

6
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:54,389
The reality and the dreams thatyou once saw crosses each other

7
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:58,260
Give me the light

8
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:02,664
Although I do not know how

9
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:10,072
So we may get to the other side

10
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:18,080
Although what we want has no real shape

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,421
Now break through the finalspace, and toward the future

12
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:39,501
As It Gets Near
